I've been writing for most of my life.
The book Writing Without Teachers introduced me to one distinction and one practice that has helped my writing processes tremendously.
The distinction is between the creative mind and the critical mind.
While you need to employ both to get to a finished result, they cannot work in parallel no matter how much we might like to think so.
Trying to criticize writing on the fly is possibly the single greatest barrier to writing that most of us encounter.
If you are listening to that 5th grade English teacher correct your grammar while you are trying to capture a fleeting thought, the thought will die.
If you capture the fleeting thought and simply share it with the world in raw form, no one is likely to understand.
You must learn to create first and then criticize if you want to make writing the tool for thinking that it is.
